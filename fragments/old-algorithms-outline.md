-   Computation and algorithms
    -   Computation: a rational process that transforms data into results
    -   Algorithm: a set of instructions, like a recipe, that tells a computer (mechanical or otherwise) how to perform a computation
-   3 parts of an algorithm
    1.  Set of instructions
    2.  Program control
    3.  A terminal condition
-   Data, processing, and input/output
    -   Data is a symbol or symbols given meaning by specific acts of interpretation (information is data plus interpreted context)
    -   Computation turns data into information by placing it in an interpretive context meaningful to humans
    -   The algorithm that transforms data into information is itself also data
    -   Data is given structure by one or more programs in the computer so it can be stored and retrieved in meaningful and useful ways
-   Managing program state
    -   The computer's or program's sequential memory (not memory as storage)
    -   A current snapshot of the computer's/program's current position in relation to the task it is currently in the process of performing
    -   The current values a program holds/references in memory based on where the program is with regards to its overall process of execution
    -   A computer's or program's output at any given time is completely determined as a function of current inputs and state
    -   Managing machine and program state is one of the most crucial (and difficult!) tasks a programmer must perform
-   The program gets data as input, performs operations on the data that move it through various states in the process, and outputs the resulting new information
