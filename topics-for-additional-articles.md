# Topics for additional articles

These ideas didn't quite make the cut for the main series, or at least they haven't yet, but I think they're still worth exploring.

1. History of computing and computers
   -   Primitive computing
   -   19th and early 20th century computing
       -   Human computing
       -   Mechanical computing
   -   The Analytical Engine: the first theoretically universal computing machine
       -   The first computer programs
       -   Ada Lovelace's vision of symbolic computing
   -   Early digital computers
       -   ABC
       -   Colossus
   -   Turing completeness and computability
       -   ENIAC – the first Turing complete digital computer
   -   Stored program computers and code as data (von Neumann architecture)
       -   Manchester Mark 1
       -   EDVAC
-   Computers continue to get smaller and faster and more powerful

2. Radical computer science/code as poetry
   -   "Radical computer science"
       -   Programming as human expression
       -   Using machines and code to express human thoughts and (hopefully) solve human problems
       -   Translating between machines and humans
   -   Programming is _hard_, regardless of whether you approach it as art or science (it's both)
   -   Code is ποίησις.
   -   Expressing ideas, not just getting computers to do things
   -   Structured programming: computing based on control and correctness
   -   Symbolic programming: computing based on ideas
       -   Taking human ideas and making them material
       -   Programs are "little bits of you that perform independently"
   -   To program is to build something, and not just crunch numbers
   -   Computing can produce art, music, architecture, theatre
   -   Symbols are data the computer, and by extension the engineer, transforms into something meaningful
-   The most important thing I can accomplish with these tutorials is to enable you to express yourself more fully by building something beautiful

3. Applications of computer science
4. Theoretical computer science
